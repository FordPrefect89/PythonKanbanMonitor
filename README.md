# PythonKanbanMonitor
Python script for the kanban monitor running on Raspian

Developing this to replace the use of the Arduino/Laptop combination currently in use.

This needs to have the GUI developed and when the program is started, check how many sensors are connected and
adust accordingly.  

The script to run with HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors alread complete.  Need to integrate the code into the GUI code
to run that code from the GUI.
